# Fun & Games with Type Classes & Property Based Testing!
Hamish Dickson

???

- Thanks for coming

---

# Goals

1. Gain some intuition about how you can use types to reason about programs
2. Understand what types aren't good at describing and understand how property based testing can help
3. Understand how property based testing fits in with TDD/standard unit tests

???

- So I'm going quickly cover two quite broad ideas in this talk
- I've advertied this as a talk about property based testing
- but I'm aware most of us here don't use typed languages, so I'd like to cover how we use types in langauges like Haskell/Idris/Scala to help design programs
- I'll probably also (grumpily) talk about java here

- Then I'm going to talk about limitations of the types we use and hopefully demostrate that we need more information

# Adder

imagine we had written a function to add a list of Ints together, it would look a bit like this

```tut
def addInts(is: List[Int]): Int = {
  if (is == Nil) 0
  else is.head + addInts(is.tail)
}
```

???



---

# Adder

what if later we did the same for multiplying Ints?

```tut
def addInts(is: List[Int]): Int = {
  if (is == Nil) 0
  else is.head + addInts(is.tail)
}

def multiplyInts(is: List[Int]): Int = {
  if (is == Nil) 1
  else is.head * addInts(is.tail)
}
```

---

# Adder

and then combining a List of Lists?

```tut
def addList[T](ls: List[List[T]]): List[T] = {
  if (ls == Nil) List()
  else ls.head ++ addList(ls.tail)
}
```

These bits of code all look very similar. Can we somehow abstract this idea out?

---

# 1st attempt - subclass polymorphism

      Well, we could try and use polymorphism to do this, but where would it live?

      We could try adding this to List

      ```tut
      trait List[A] {
        //...
        def adder(ls: List[A]): A
        //...
      }
      ```

      but then what? How do we implement this? Each type has a different implemention - does that mean we have to implement `adder` on Int?

      That's a crap approach

      - Int shouldn't know about List
      - Int has 2 different implementations of adder
      - What if we have a list where `adder` doesn't makes sense? Our approach forces us to implement it anyway

      .. Not to mention, we can't modify List like this anyway

      Lets try something else

      # Type classes

      Lets look at our implementation again

      ```scala
      def addInts(is: List[Int]): Int = {
        if (is == Nil) 0
        else is.head + addInts(is.tail)
      }
      ```

      Each implementation has a zeroy-thing (of type T) and a combiney-thing (T -> T -> T)

      lets rewrite our function to show that

      ```scala
      def adder[T](ts: List[T], zero: T, combine: (T,T) => T): T = {
        if (ts == Nil) zero
        else combine(ts.head, adder(ts.tail))
      }
      ```

      Lets wrap up `zero` and `combine` together

      ```tut
      trait Monoid[T] {
        def zero: T
        def combine(a: T, b: T): T
      }
```

```scala
      def adder[T](ts: List[T], M: Monoid[T]): T = {
        if (ts == Nil) M.zero
        else M.combine(ts.head, adder(ts.tail))
      }
      ```

      Cool. That means we just have to implement this thing with the silly name for each type it's appropriate for

      ```scala
      val intAddMonoid = new Monoid[Int] {
        def zero: Int = 0
        def combine(a: Int, b: Int): Int = a + b
      }

      def listMonoid[T] = new Monoid[List[T]] {
        def zero: List[T] = List[T]()
        def combine(a: List[T], b: List[T]): List[T] = a ++ b
      }
      ```

      then

      ```scala
      adder(List(1,2,3,4), intAddMonoid)
      ```

      Note: I won't cover why here, but in scala you would just write `adder(List(1,2,3,4))` and the compiler will implicitly find the appropriate monoid for you

      This approach is called ad-hoc polymorphism (or type classing) and has several advantages over subclass-polymorphism
      - it allows us to create functions (eg adder) for types (eg List) without modifying the type itself
      - it has grounding in mathematics and provably more powerful than subclassing
      - you aren't forced to implement `adder` for everything which could be a List

      It also has disadvantages over subclassing, the big one is you need a true type system to implement it property (this example would work in java, but many many others wouldn't)

      # So what?

      Great.... but I thought this was a talk about property based testing?

      Let's look at this Monoid thing again

      ```tut
      trait Monoid[T] {
        def zero: T
        def combine(a: T, b: T): T
      }
      ```

      There are more rules here than we can express in the trait, specifically

      ```scala
      combine(combine(a,b), c) == combine(a,combine(b, c)) // it's associative
      combine(zero, a) == combine(a, zero) == a // zero is actually a left/right identity
      ```

      These are typically called Laws, but there is no way to express these in the type signature (active area of research, Alonzo Church's paper in 1936 suggests you can, but we don't know how to do it)

      # So what else can we do?

      Write tests!

      *Loic jumps for joy*

      Note: This sound great, but is actually a sad moment

      # What would that look like?

      We need these laws to hold for all elements - we don't want selection bias to come into our tests - pick values at random
