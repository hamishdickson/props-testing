# Fun & Games with Type Classes & Property Based Testing!
Hamish Dickson

???

- First off, thanks for coming
- Just so I have an idea, who here knows what a type class is?
- and property based testing?

- So these ideas aren't strictly related, but you often see them together and I think it would be interesting to talk about them both today

---

# Goals

1. Gain some intuition about how you can use types to reason about programs
2. Understand what types aren't good at describing and understand how property based testing can help
3. Understand how property based testing fits in with TDD/standard unit tests

???

- So the aim of today is to quickly cover these two ideas

- I'm aware most of use here don't use typed languages (in fact - java doesn't have a true type system)
- so I want to cover how types are used in Idris/Haskell/Scala/Purescript
- Then I'm going to talk about how property based testing fits in with that

# Adderer

Imagine we had written a function to add a list of Ints together, it would look a bit like this

```tut:silent
def addInts(is: List[Int]): Int = {
  if (is == Nil) 0
  else is.head + addInts(is.tail)
}
```

???

- OK, lets dive right into an example
- Imagine we need to write some function to sum a list of Ints
- this is what it would look like in Scala...
- well kind of - in reality you'd use pattern matching rather than an 'if' statement here, but I don't want to cover that

```tut:silent
def addInts(is: List[Int]): Int = {
  if (is == Nil) 0
  else is.head + addInts(is.tail)
}
```

What if we wanted combine some list of lists into another list

```tut:silent
def flattenList[T](ls: List[List[T]]): List[T] = {
  if (ls == Nil) List()
  else ls.head ++ flattenList(ls.tail)
}
```

???

- this is pretty much flatten
- ++ is append in scala

```

These are both just adding things together - can we abstract this out?

# 1st attempt - subclass polymorphism

Well, the standard way to abstract ideas out liks this in java is to use what's called subclass-polymorphism

```tut:silent
trait List[A] {
  def adder(ls: List[A]): A

  //...
}
```



???

- one way to approach this is to add some function `adder` to the List trait (scala doesn't have interfaces)

```tut:silent
trait List[A] {
  def adder(ls: List[A]): A

  //...
}
```

this approach is terrible

this approach is terrible

- it's hard to imagine where implementations of this would live - it doesn't even make sense on implementations of List
- does that mean Int has to know about List? That's insane
- adder doesn't make sense for some A's - how would you implement adder for a list of Dogs?

But subclass polymorphism gives us the GoF book!

      # Type classes

      Lets look at our implementation again

      ```scala
      def addInts(is: List[Int]): Int = {
        if (is == Nil) 0
        else is.head + addInts(is.tail)
      }
      ```

      Each implementation has a zeroy-thing (of type T) and a combiney-thing (T -> T -> T)

      lets rewrite our function to show that

      ```scala
      def adder[T](ts: List[T], zero: T, combine: (T,T) => T): T = {
        if (ts == Nil) zero
        else combine(ts.head, adder(ts.tail))
      }
      ```

      Lets wrap up `zero` and `combine` together

      ```tut
      trait Monoid[T] {
        def zero: T
        def combine(a: T, b: T): T
      }
```

```scala
      def adder[T](ts: List[T], M: Monoid[T]): T = {
        if (ts == Nil) M.zero
        else M.combine(ts.head, adder(ts.tail))
      }
      ```

      Cool. That means we just have to implement this thing with the silly name for each type it's appropriate for

      ```scala
      val intAddMonoid = new Monoid[Int] {
        def zero: Int = 0
        def combine(a: Int, b: Int): Int = a + b
      }

      def listMonoid[T] = new Monoid[List[T]] {
        def zero: List[T] = List[T]()
        def combine(a: List[T], b: List[T]): List[T] = a ++ b
      }
      ```

      then

      ```scala
      adder(List(1,2,3,4), intAddMonoid)
      ```

      Note: I won't cover why here, but in scala you would just write `adder(List(1,2,3,4))` and the compiler will implicitly find the appropriate monoid for you

      This approach is called ad-hoc polymorphism (or type classing) and has several advantages over subclass-polymorphism
      - it allows us to create functions (eg adder) for types (eg List) without modifying the type itself
      - it has grounding in mathematics and provably more powerful than subclassing
      - you aren't forced to implement `adder` for everything which could be a List

      It also has disadvantages over subclassing, the big one is you need a true type system to implement it property (this example would work in java, but many many others wouldn't)

      # So what?

      Great.... but I thought this was a talk about property based testing?

      Let's look at this Monoid thing again

      ```tut
      trait Monoid[T] {
        def zero: T
        def combine(a: T, b: T): T
      }
      ```

      There are more rules here than we can express in the trait, specifically

      ```scala
      combine(combine(a,b), c) == combine(a,combine(b, c)) // it's associative
      combine(zero, a) == combine(a, zero) == a // zero is actually a left/right identity
      ```

      These are typically called Laws, but there is no way to express these in the type signature (active area of research, Alonzo Church's paper in 1936 suggests you can, but we don't know how to do it)

      # So what else can we do?

      Write tests!

      *Loic jumps for joy*

      Note: This sound great, but is actually a sad moment

      # What would that look like?

      We need these laws to hold for all elements - we don't want selection bias to come into our tests - pick values at random
